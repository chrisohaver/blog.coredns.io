CoreDNS-009 has been [released](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/tag/v009)!

CoreDNS is a DNS server that chains middleware, where each middleware implements a DNS feature.

Release v009 is mostly a bugfix release, with a few new features in the middleware.

# Core

No changes.

# Middleware

* *secondary*: fix functionality and improve matching of notify queries.
* *cache*: fix data race.
* *proxy*: async healthchecks.
* *reverse*: new option `wildcard` that also catches all subdomains of a template.
* *kubernetes*: experimental new option `autopath` that optimizes the search path and ndots
  combinatorial explosion, so clients with a large search path and high ndots will get a reply on
  the first query.
