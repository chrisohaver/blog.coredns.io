Quiz time, in the following Corefile:

~~~ txt
. {
  proxy . 8.8.8.8:53
  file db.example.com
}
~~~

Will a query for `www.google.com` be handled by the *proxy* or the *file* middleware? Answer below.

What does this Corefile actually say? It specifies that queries for root (`.`) and *everything*
below it (so for all domain names) we should enter this stanza.

Next *all* queries should be forwarded to 8.8.8.8:53.

Then because the *file* middleware **does not** specify what zones should be answered from the
`db.example.com` file, the toplevel one applies, which is root (`.`)

So we are left with a situation where both middlewares will be called for the same names (which can
be perfectly valid for middleware that calls other chained-in middleware).

But *proxy* **will not** call *file* because the query will be answered and done with after
the middleware exists - the same is true for the opposite direction.

To look what into what happens here we have to look the [directives
ordering](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/blob/master/core/dnsserver/directives.go#L75):

~~~
    ...
    "dnssec",
    "file",
    "secondary",
    "etcd",
    "kubernetes",
    "proxy",
    "whoami"
    ...
~~~

And we see that *file* is first and *proxy* comes somewhat later. This means that in the example
above *all* queries are routed to the *file* middleware. It will happily answer those with SERVFAIL,
because it probably can't find `www.google.com` in a file that will mostly have `*.example.com`
names in it.

In order to fix this, we should either have to separate stanza or specify the origin(s) for the
*file* middleware:

~~~ txt
. {
  proxy . 8.8.8.8:53
  file db.example.com example.com
}
~~~

To preempt a feature request: Yes, it would be nice of CoreDNS can detect and warn about this (it
does not do this now).
