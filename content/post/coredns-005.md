CoreDNS-005 has been [released](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/tag/v005)!

CoreDNS is a DNS server that chains middleware, where each middleware implements a DNS feature.

# What is New

# Core

A way to configure (external) middleware was added. Edit `middleware.cfg` and do a `go gen && go
build` and your middleware has been added. This allows for out-of-tree middleware to be easily
added. Documentation can be found in
[middleware.cfg](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/blob/master/middleware.cfg).

## Middleware improvements

### New

* *erratic*: a new middleware that can drop queries, limited in the current functionality, but useful for testing.
* *trace*: a new middleware that implements OpenTracing-based tracing using Zipkin.

### Improvements/changes

* *proxy*: fix a bug when a connection hangs and never gets release (#467)
* *proxy*: Fold *httpproxy* into it, which is now a normal proxy with a special `protocol`. For
  Monitoring an extra label was added: `proxy_proto` that shows the protocol used (`dns` or `https_google`). 
  See the [proxy README.md](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/blob/master/middleware/proxy/README.md) for details.
* *httpproxy*: removed because functionality is moved to *proxy*.
* *kubernetes*: Now implements the full
  [Kubernetes DNS Specification](https://github.com/kubernetes/dns/blob/master/docs/specification.md),
  including regular and headless services, endpoint hostnames, A, SRV, and PTR records.
* *kubernetes*: Implements the `pod` type for requests in both a Kube-DNS compatible mode
  (`insecure`) and a mode which validates that the IP in question belongs to a pod in the specified
  namespace (`verified`)
* *kubernetes*: Simplified the configuration of reverse zones. Instead of listing the zones in the
  zone list, you can just add a list of CIDRs using the `cidrs` option.
* *rewrite*: allow rewriting more bits of the incoming packet. This required some backward
  *incompatible* changes, e.g. a new **FIELD** keyword is now required. See the 
  [rewrite README.md](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/blob/master/middleware/rewrite/README.md) for details.
